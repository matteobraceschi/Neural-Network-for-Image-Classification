# Leaf Classification

This repository contains the code for the homework project of the course Artificial Neural Networks And Deep Learning held at Politecnico Di Milano.

# About the Project

## Specifications 

The problem is a multiclass classification problem. 

In this homework we were required to classify images of leafs, which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.

The metric used to evaluate models was the Mean Accuracy. The score is computed as
MeanAccuracy = Σ 1≤i≤N(prediction == target) / N , where N is the total number of images in the test set.

# Built With

The project was developed using Jupiter Notebook and Tensorflow library.

You can find code, a report with all explainations and datasets in the respective folders. For running the first homework you have to use the riordina_directory.py script to prepare the dataset to be correctly loaded.
